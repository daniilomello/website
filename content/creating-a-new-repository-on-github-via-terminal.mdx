Hi Friend!

Today I wanna share with you how I quickly create new repositories on GitHub just using my Terminal.

If you didn’t know, GitHub has a [CLI](https://cli.github.com/), that enable you to create and manipulate your repositories. Which make your life easier when you are creating new repositories for your projects, prototypes and POCs. [You can Install here](https://cli.github.com/).

Once you install the CLI follow the steps below to create a new repository.

01 – First, initialize Git:

```bash
git init
```

02 – Second, create a new branch called main:

```bash
git checkout -b main
```

03 – Now create a new repository using the `gh` command.

```bash
gh repo create repo-name --public --source=. --remote=origin
```

- The flag `--remote` define origin name for the repository
- The flag `--source` define the path/folder for the repository
- The flag `--public` make the repository public

04 – Once you create the repository, add all files to staged:

```bash
git add .
```

05 – Now create your first commit:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add initial files"
```

06 – And push all your updates to the main branch:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

07 – Now to see if it worked it properly, try to access the repository:

```bash
gh browse
```

Great! You did it! You just create a repository via terminal.
