Hey folks!

Today I wanna share with you how I quickly create new repositories on GitHub just using my Terminal.

If you didn't knew Github has a [CLI](https://cli.github.com/), that enable you to create and manipulate your repositories. Which make your life easier when you are creating new repository for your projects, prototypes and POCs. [Install here](https://cli.github.com/)

Once you install the CLI follow the steps below to create a new repository.

First, initialize Git:

```bash
git init
```

Second, create a new branch called main:

```bash
git checkout -b main
```


Now create a new repository using the `gh` command.

```bash
gh repo create repo-name --public --source=. --remote=origin
```

- A flag `--public` make the repository public
- A flag `--source` define the path/folder for the repository
- A flag `--remote` define origin name for the repository


Once you create the repository, add all files to staged:

```bash
git add .
```

Now create your first commit:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add initial react files"
```

And push all your updates to the main branch:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Now to see if it worked it properly, try to access the repository:

```bash
gh browse
```

Great! You did it! You just create a resposity via terminal.
