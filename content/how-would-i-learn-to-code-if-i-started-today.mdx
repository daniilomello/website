title: How I would learn to code if I started today

Hey folks!

Today, I wanna talk about how I’d go about learning to code if I were starting from scratch. 

It’s overwhelming, right? Figuring out where to start, what to focus on, and how to not get buried under it all. I get it. I’ve been there. 

And that’s why I wanna break it down for you in a way that feels doable, something you can actually stick to.

Here’s the thing: I’d start with a project. Not just any project—a project I _actually care about_. Maybe something small that could make my life a bit easier, like automating a boring task or building a little tool for my daily routine. 

This method it’s called “base project learning,” and it’s a game-changer. You use what you know, then figure out the rest as you go.

But let me warn you, don’t go too big too fast. If your project feels like climbing Everest, you’ll never start. And if it’s too simple, you’ll finish it and feel…meh. 

Find the sweet spot. Pick something challenging enough to keep you excited but small enough that it feels possible. Then break it down into tiny steps. 

Maybe deliver something small every week or even every day.

Once you’ve got that project in mind, choose your language. I’d go with something beginner-friendly like Python or JavaScript. 

Install the tools, set up your environment, and write that classic first “Hello, World!” program. That’s your green light—it means you’re ready to go.

Next, get comfortable with the basics. For example,  learn to declare variables, write functions, and mess around with loops. 

To level up, tackle some algorithm problems. They might seem unrelated to your project, but they sharpen your problem-solving skills—and trust me, you’ll need that.

But don’t lose sight of your project! Keep adding features, making it better, challenging yourself. 

If it feels overwhelming, break the problem into bite-sized pieces. Ask yourself questions, what’s working, what isn’t, and how can I make it simpler? Clarity comes from asking.

And hey, if you’re stuck, don’t sweat it. Sometimes it just means you need to brush up on the basics. Go back, review, and try again. It’s not a step backward—it’s part of the process. 

And explain your work, even if it’s just to yourself or a friend. You’ll be surprised how much clearer things get when you put it into words.

To help be more productive, take care of yourself. Sleep those eight hours. Make a focus playlist. 

Use a time to work focused for 1 hour, and take a 20 minutes break. Block distractions, turn off your phone, and maybe grab some noise-canceling headphones.

Keep your tasks organized. Group by analytic for planning and researching, and creative for coding and designing. Now use your energy base on those groups

You’ve got this. One small step at a time, you’ll not just learn to code—you’ll build something you’re proud of. 

And trust me, there’s no better feeling than seeing your idea come to life. 

Keep going.
