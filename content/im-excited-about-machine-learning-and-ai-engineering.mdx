I’m have been studying about AI in the past few weeks, and I got say: feels good to be excited with technology again.

I feel like in the early days (10 years ago) when I was learning and playing around with some html and css.

Using AI tools is often easy, and my curiosity to understand how everything is working behind the scene, brought me to this new world/field filled with exciting things to learn.

I can wait to share my new second brain/knowledge hub/today I learn repository and website.

I’m still figuring out the name, but it already has some notes there.

Anyways, just wanted to share my excitement.

Let me go back to my studies
