I’m avoiding content from people who say that AI is going to replace engineers, developers, you and me.

This kind of statement brings negative feelings toward AI and creates fear, just to attract attention and engagement.

Instead, I’m focusing on those who inspire us to change and grow to use AI to boost our human potential and create amazing things.

Innovation is not new in human history. It’s what brought us here, to this day, from drawing with rocks in a cave to creating incredible digital art.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed with all these AI tools popping up everywhere, slow down a little. You’ve got this.

Embrace change, but learn things on your own terms, at your own pace, and in your own time. You don’t have to know every tool or master everything.

Look for what interests you the most, try it out, see if it aligns with your values and passions and work with these tools, not against them.

Tools and technologies will always evolve, and you are perfectly capable of learning and evolving with them.

Stay in pace. Nothing can replace you.
