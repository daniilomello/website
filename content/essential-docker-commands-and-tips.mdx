## 💡 Introduction

Docker is a powerful tool that simplifies application deployment by using containerization. This guide aims to help you understand and efficiently use Docker in your daily development workflow. By the end of this article, you will have a basic understanding about Docker commands and best practices.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before diving into the commands: 
1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started). 
2. Basic knowledge of the command line will also be helpful.

## ✍️ Getting Started with Docker

### 👉 Basic Docker Commands

To run your first container, use the `docker run` command. It will check if the image is available locally; if not, it will download it and then execute the container.

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

To view active containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

To view all containers, including stopped ones:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

To start and stop containers:

```bash
docker start container-name
docker stop container-name
```

To run a container and delete it after execution:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ubuntu bash
```

To access a running container:

```bash
docker exec -it container-name bash
```

To remove a container:

```bash
docker rm container-name -f
```

To remove all containers at once:

```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) -f
```

### 👉 Bind Mounts

Bind mounts allow you to map a local directory to a container directory, ensuring persistent storage.

```bash
docker run -d --name nginx -p 80:80 -v /c/users/danilo/www/html:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
```

Using the `mount` flag:

```bash
docker run -d --name nginx -p 80:80 --mount type=bind,source=/c/users/danilo/www/html,target=/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
```

### 👉 Docker Volumes

Docker volumes are the preferred way to handle persistent data.

To create a volume:

```bash
docker volume create volume-name
```

To inspect a volume:

```bash
docker volume inspect volume-name
```

To attach a volume to a container:

```bash
docker run --name nginx -d --mount type=volume,source=volume-name,target=/app nginx
```

To clean up unused volumes:

```bash
docker volume prune
```

### 👉 Docker Compose

Docker Compose allows you to define multi-container applications using a YAML file.

Below has an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file, for **laravel** and **nginx** container application services, where the images is coming from my Docker Hub account.

```yml
version: '3'

services: 
  laravel:
    build:
      context: ./laravel
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.prod
    image: daniilomello/laravel:prod
    container_name: laravel
    networks:
      - laranet

  nginx:
    build:
      context: ./nginx
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.prod
    image: daniilomello/nginx:prod
    container_name: nginx
    networks:
      - laranet
    ports:
      - "8080:80"

networks:
  laranet:
    driver: bridge
```

To start the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

To stop the containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### 👉 Working with Docker Images

To download an image:

```bash
docker pull image-name
```

To list available images:

```bash
docker images
```

To remove an image:

```bash
docker rmi image-name
```

Example `Dockerfile` for creating a custom image:

```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:latest

WORKDIR /app

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install vim -y

COPY html/ /usr/share/nginx/html

ENTRYPOINT ["/docker-entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

To build and run your custom image:

```bash
docker build -t daniilomello/image-name .
docker run --rm -d -p 8080:80 daniilomello/image-name
```

To push your image to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker push daniilomello/image-name
```

### 👉 Docker Networking

Docker provides different network types for container communication.

To clean up unused networks:

```bash
docker network prune
```

To inspect an existing network:

```bash
docker network inspect bridge
```

To create a new network:

```bash
docker network create --driver bridge network-name
```

To run a container within a network:

```bash
docker run -dit --name ubuntu1 --network network-name bash
```

To connect an existing container to a network:

```bash
docker network connect network-name ubuntu3
```

## 🚀 Creating a NodeJS Express API

Create a container with a volume for your Node.js project:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v //c/Users/danilo/www/docker/node/:/usr/src/app -p 3001:3001 node:15 bash
```

Initialize a `package.json` file:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Install Express:

```bash
npm install express
```

Create an `index.js` file:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3001;

app.get('/', (req,res) => {
    res.send('<h1>Hello World</h1>');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`🚀 Running on http://localhost:${port}/`);
});
```

Create a `Dockerfile` for your Node.js API:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:15

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3001

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

Build and run the image:

```bash
docker build -t daniilomello/api-node .
docker run --name api-node daniilomello/api-node
```

Push it to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker push daniilomello/api-node
```
