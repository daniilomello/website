This post is a friendly guide to help you quickly find the most essential Git commands. I've got you covered!

## Git Configuration

**Setting up an username and email:**
```bash
git config --global user.name "Danilo Mello"

git config --global user.email "danilo@email.com"
```

**Checking user configurations:**
```bash
git config user.name

git config user.email

git config --list
```

**Creating alias:**
```bash
git config --global alias.s status
```

## Creating a new respository

**Initializing a new respository**
```bash
git init
```

**Add remote repository**
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/reponame.git
```

**Cloning a repository**
```bash
git clone git@github.com/username/reponame.git foldername # or use . for current folder
```

**Checking your remotes**
```bash
git remote -v
```

**Checkting the status of the files**

Here is the life cycle of the files on Git:

- Untracked: file was created but git it's not tracking;
- Unmodified: files was recognized but it wasn't modified;
- Modified: files was recognized and modified;
- Staged: files was recognized and ready to be commited;

```bash
git status
```

**Adding files to staged**
```bash
git add filename
git add . # To add all files
```

**Commiting files**

First, what is a commit? It's basically a snapshot off the current state of one or multiple files.

When creating a commit you have to pass the `-m` flag to indicate that is receiving a commit message. You can also add to stage and commit at the same time using the `-am` flag.

```bash
git commmit -m "My first commit right here"
git commit -am "Adding to stage and commiting at the same time"
```

You can also commit pieces of chages by using the `-p` flag. Press `y` to accept the change or `n` to deny.

```bash
git add -p
```

## Analyzing your commits

**Checking your commits log**

You can see your commit history and filter through a bunch of options like: commit hash, author, date, or a commit message. And, see everything in a graph format.


```bash
git log
git log --author="Danilo"
git log --since="Jan 01 2025" --until="March 01 2025"
git log --graph
git log --pretty=oneline --graph --all # All details in graph about your commits
```

You can get a short version of your commits using the shortlog. And use the `-sn` flag to get the numbers of commits per contributor.

```bash
git shortlog
git shortlog -sn
```

**Advanced log**
```bash
git reflog
```

**Getting more information about one commit**

```bash
git show commitHashHere
```

**Checking the files modifications by comparing changes**

```bash
git diff
git diff --name-only # To see files that was modified
```

## Manipulating commits

**Editing a commit message**
```bash
git commit --amend
```

**Removing changes from a file**

```bash
git checkout filename
```

**Removing a file from staged**

**Undo files changes**

```bash
git reset HEAD filename
```

To reset a commit you have to use the reset, but you can also pass different flags to manipulate your command.

- The flag `--soft`, will undo your commit and send files back to staged;
- The flag `--mixed`, will unedo your commit and send files back to modified;
- The flag `--hard`, will remove all the changes forever;

When you use the `--hard` flag, you will modify your commit history wich can create a problem on pushing your changes, in this you can use `--force` flag to force a push.

```bash
git reset --soft commitHash
git reset --mixed commitHash
git reset --hard commitHash
```

**Adding a commit change to your Branch**
Use cherry-pick to apply a specific commit to your current branch (Learn about branch on next topic). It works by taking the changes from the commit and applying to your current branch. This is useful when you want to take a single commit from a branch and apply it to another branch.
```bash
git cherry-pick commitHash
```

**Combining commits**
The flag `-i` is to open menu where you have to where to inicial commit to be combined start, and number 2 is to decide how many commits will be combined. Use the squash option on thoses that you want to combine.

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~2
```

**Fixing commits**
```bash
git commit --fixup commitHash
```

**Combining the fixup commits**
hash of the commit has to be previous of the one you want to combine.

```bash
git reabase -i --autosquash commitHash 
```

## Manipulating Branches

What is a branch? I like to describe a branch like a line of development. The most common use of branches is to isolate a new feature or bug-fix from the main line of development (usually called "main") until it is ready to be merged in.

Is an incredible way to work with multiple people, without touching the core of the project and avoid conflicts.

**Creating an new brach**
```bash
git checkout -b branchName
```

**Checking the list of branches**
```bash
git branch
```

**Navigating to a branch**
```bash
git checkout branchName
```

**Going back a branch**
```bash
git checkout -
```

**Removing a branch**
```bash
git branch -D branchName
```

**Merging a branch**
A Merge is when you are ready to integrate your current separate line of development into main line of development. By doing the merge, you have to create commit and define merge message.

**Rebase a branch**
It works in the same way as the merge, but without creating a commit, keeping the commit history more clean.

```bash
git merge branchName
git rebase branchName
```

**Pulling with Rebase to evoid conflict**
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
```


**Finalizing an conflict on git**
The `--continue` flag is used to proceed with a merge or rebase operation after resolving conflicts

```bash
git merge --continue
git rebase --continue
```

## Saving modifications

Useful when you're navigating between branches and you don't want to commit your changes.

**Stashing your current changes**
```bash
git stash
```

**Applying an stashed change**
```bash
git stash apply
```

**Seeing your stashed changes**
```bash
git stash list
```

**Cleating all your stashed changes**
```bash
git stash clear
```

## Pushing your changes
Sending your changes to a remote respository.

```bash
git push origin main
```

**Creating version tags for your release or pushes**
```bash
git tag -a 1.0.0 -m "My first relesase version"
git push origin main --tags
```

**Undo an push**
You can undo a push by reverting to an specific commit before the push.
```bash
git revert commitHash
```
