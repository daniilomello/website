## Welcome to Markdown

This is a sample post to demonstrate how the new **Markdown-based** blog system works. You can write your posts using standard Markdown syntax directly in the `content/` directory.

### Code Blocks

Here's an example of a code block with syntax highlighting:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

### Features

- Write posts in Markdown or MDX
- Frontmatter metadata (title, date, category, language, etc.)
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- No external CMS dependency

### Links and Formatting

You can use *italic*, **bold**, and `inline code` formatting. Links work too: [Visit my site](https://daniilo.dev).

> Blockquotes are also supported and look great.

That's it! Just create a new `.mdx` file in the `content/` folder and it will automatically appear on your blog.
