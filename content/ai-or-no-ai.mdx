I removed every post that I use AI to write.

It’s not because AI it’s bad, but my goal with this blog or whatever you can call it, it’s not to share AI generated content or create a huge amount of content.

It’s just about writing down my thoughts, trying to build sentences, paragraphs, and connecting ideas, by writing one word after another and reading to see if it makes sense.

Therefore, for now on, I won’t be using any AI to create content for this website. I’m gonna do my best to write myself. Because, as human beings, we are capable to think and write. We should not forget about this ability that we have.

Anyway, I also want to create a more personal content, and maybe trying to build a voice around the things that I write, so you know that it’s me. Like some sort of identity or style.

Hopefully, I’m gonna be able to do this.

I will use AI to review my notes, though. In order to avoid any grammar mistakes, that passes through my eyes.

But this is still coming from my head, from the darkness of my thoughts, and I’m bringing to life.

With that being said, welcome to my personal weird blog.

See you soon.
